# The daily driver

What a browser needs before someone can use it all day: right-click, downloads, file upload and
the page's own dialogs. Built in this order, one branch each, in Standard first, then Glide, then
the other shells through their owners. Mac first, then Android where it applies.

One rule for all four. **Go owns each request a page makes:** what is asked, the choices, how long
it lives, and what the answer does. The shell only draws it and sends back the choice. Each live
request has an id and sits in the state the SDK keeps; the shell answers by that id, and Go ignores
an answer to one it has dropped. What the OS already draws stays native: the file chooser and the
Save panel.

## Right-click

A right-click in a page, or a long press on a phone, reaches Go through content's
`HandleContextMenu`, which Go answers as handled. Go works out what can run there and sends it to
the window's shell as `contextMenu`. The shell designs and draws the menu, and sends back the
action chosen. Go runs it.

**The context.** `state.contextMenu` is `null`, or:

| Field | What it is |
|---|---|
| `id` | This menu's number. A newer right-click replaces it |
| `tab`, `x`, `y` | The tab, and where in its page, in the page's CSS pixels |
| `link`, `linkText` | The link pressed on, and its words |
| `src`, `media` | An image's address, or another medium's, and which: `image`, `video`, `audio` |
| `selection` | The text selected |
| `editable` | The press was in a field, for cut, copy, paste and select all |
| `actions` | What can run here: `{id, title, group, enabled}`, and `actions` of its own for a submenu |

**The actions.** Go lists only what it can run here and now. Ids never change once released, so a
shell may give an id an icon, or leave it out.

| Group | Actions |
|---|---|
| `link` | `link.newTab` Open Link in New Tab, `link.workspace` Open Link in Workspace (a submenu, `link.workspace.<id>` per other workspace), `link.newWindow` Open Link in New Window, `link.copy` Copy Link |
| `image` | `image.newTab` Open Image in New Tab, `image.copyAddress` Copy Image Address |
| `selection` | `selection.copy` Copy, `selection.search` Search for "…" |
| `edit` | `edit.undo`, `edit.redo`, `edit.cut`, `edit.copy`, `edit.paste`, `edit.selectAll` |
| `page` | `page.back` Back, `page.forward` Forward, `page.reload` Reload |

Back and Forward come disabled when there is nowhere to go. A press on a link in a field gets both
groups. Save Link As and Save Image As come with downloads, Copy Image and Inspect when the engine
has them, and Print and View Source later.

**The messages.** The shell sends `contextMenuChoose {id, item}` to run an action, or
`contextMenuClose {id}` when the menu goes without one. Go then sends `contextMenu` with `null`.
Go also drops the menu, and sends `null`, when its tab closes, navigates or stops being the active
one. Copying is Go's, through the engine's clipboard, so no shell needs `navigator.clipboard`.

**The design is the shell's.** It may order, group and leave out Go's actions, and add actions of
its own (Glide's Pin, say). Separators are its choice; `group` is there to help. In Standard it is
the design system's menu ([design-system.md](design-system.md)), at the press, kept inside the
window.

**A shell that draws nothing** shows no menu: content's own on the Mac is none. The contract's
rule 16 ([shells.md](shells.md#what-every-shell-does)) is what catches it.

**Android.** Go sends only presses on a link or an image. A long press on text or in a field keeps
Android's own selection bar, which already copies, pastes and selects. The Mobile shell's link
sheet opens on the same message, and still builds its own items from the press.
